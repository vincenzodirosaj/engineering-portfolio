## Project Overview

This project models the flight dynamics of a **water-propelled rocket–glider** developed for the 2023 Airbus Sloshing Rocket Workshop. The objective was to assess how aircraft geometry and a **deployable V-tail** affect flight stability, trajectory, and range.

A MATLAB/Simulink simulation framework was developed to compare two flight configurations:

- **Gliding mode:** the V-tail deploys to generate aerodynamic forces and pitching moments that support the descent and pull-up maneuver.
- **Non-gliding mode:** the same basic model is evaluated without the tail's aerodynamic contribution.

The simulation supported iterative design decisions for the team's competition aircraft.

## Engineering Approach

The model integrates several disciplines:

| Area | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Aircraft geometry | Component-based geometric and material definitions |
| Mass properties | Center of gravity and inertia calculations |
| Aerodynamics | Digital DATCOM coefficients imported into MATLAB and represented using Simulink lookup tables |
| Propulsion | Water-rocket thrust profile, including thrust eccentricity and its pitching moment |
| Flight dynamics | Variable-mass, 3-DOF equations of motion in Simulink |
| Configuration analysis | Eight V-tail folding configurations between 0° (closed) and 75° (fully deployed) |
| Visualization | Trajectory comparison and 3-DOF flight animation |

### Vehicle Concept

The aircraft uses a **foldable V-tail** to transition from a rocket-like ascent configuration to a gliding descent configuration. Its tail opening angle is associated with the vehicle's elevation angle to influence pitching behavior throughout the flight.

The team's physical vehicle used a **2 L PET propulsion bottle**, **0.7 L of water**, and a **10 bar initial pressure**. The design also incorporated a separate tank intended to introduce water sloshing during the competition.

## Simulation Results

In the reported simulation scenario:

- **+6.545 m flight-range advantage** for the gliding configuration relative to the non-gliding configuration.
- **8.4987 m maximum altitude** for both simulated configurations.
- The deployable tail enabled a post-apogee pitch-down and subsequent pull-up maneuver, improving the modeled descent trajectory.

The numerical results were approximate and were used to inform the design alongside physical flight testing.

## Assumptions and Scope

The reported flight model adopts four simplifying assumptions:

1. The aircraft is treated as a **rigid body**.
2. **Water sloshing is neglected** in the simulation.
3. **Avionics latency is neglected**.
4. The aircraft is assumed to have **longitudinal symmetry**.

**Important:** Although water sloshing was a central requirement of the *competition*, the published simulation **does not directly model sloshing dynamics**. The results therefore describe the simplified flight-dynamics model, not a validated sloshing-response simulation.
